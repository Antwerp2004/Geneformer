# Geneformer Project

## Overview

**Geneformer** is a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model pretrained on over **29.9 million** human single-cell transcriptomes (Genecorpus-30M) to enable accurate, data-efficient predictions in network biology. By leveraging a self-supervised **masked learning** objective during pretraining and fine-tuning on limited downstream datasets, Geneformer:  

- Learns fundamental gene network dynamics and context-specific embeddings.  
- Excels at diverse tasks including **cell type annotation**, **gene dosage sensitivity**, **chromatin state prediction**, and **in silico perturbation** for therapeutic target discovery.  
- Demonstrates strong performance on rare diseases and clinically challenging tissues by transferring knowledge from large-scale unlabeled data.

## Key Features

- **Self-Supervised Pretraining**: 15% masked gene prediction across 30M single-cell profiles.  
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune on as few as hundreds of task-specific examples.  
- **Attention Visualization**: Identify network hierarchies and key regulatory genes via model attention weights.  
- **In Silico Perturbation**: Model gene deletion and activation effects on cell and gene embeddings for discovery of candidate therapeutic targets.

> **Note:** I exclude environment folders (e.g. anaconda3/), VS Code settings (e.g. .vscode/), and other hidden config dirs (.ssh/, .ipython/) via .gitignore to keep the repo lightweight.

## Getting Started

This project uses **Anaconda** for environment management and includes a preconfigured `geneformer_env` environment.

1. **Select the kernel in VS Code**
  - Open any Jupyter notebook in the notebooks/ folder.
  - Click the kernel selector (top-right).
  - Choose Python (geneformer_env) as the active interpreter.

2. **Prepare data**  
   - Tokenize raw `.loom` or `.h5ad` files with `tokenize_data.py`.  
   - Use `prepare_data()` to generate labeled `.dataset` for training/testing.

3. **Train & Validate**  
   ```bash
   python geneformer_test/cell_classification.ipynb \
     --input data/cell_type_train_data.dataset \
     -- model data/pancreas_model \
   ```

4. **Evaluate**  
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py \
     --model data/pancreas_model \
     --test data/pancreas_scib_labeled_test.dataset
     --test data/pancreas_scib_filtered.dataset
   ```

## Notes for Recruiters

- This project demonstrates **advanced skills** in:  
  - **Deep Learning**: Transformers, masked modeling, transfer learning.  
  - **Single-Cell Analysis**: Tokenization of transcriptomes, Scanpy & Loom integration.  
  - **Software Engineering**: Python package development, Hugging Face Datasets, reproducible environments.  
  - **Data Visualization**: Embedding and attention weight UMAPs, confusion matrices, performance dashboards.  

- **Impact**: Geneformer’s ability to leverage large unlabeled corpora to boost predictive accuracy on limited data opens avenues in rare disease research, target discovery, and precision cardiology.
